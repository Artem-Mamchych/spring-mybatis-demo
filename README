Initialize mysql database with script /sql/initdb.sql

Change mysql login/password in files:
src/main/resources/iBatisConfig.xml
src/main/resources/ibatorConfig.xml

To build and deploy application use:

mvn jetty:run-war
This goal will first package your webapp as a war file and then deploy it to Jetty.
If you set a non-zero scanInterval Jetty will watch your pom.xml and the war file and if either changes, it will redeploy the war.
